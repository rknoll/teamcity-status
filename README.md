# Travis CI Status Lite Package

Like travis-ci-status but less pro.

## Installing

Use the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run
`apm install travis-ci-status` from the command line.

## Usage

The Travis CI build status for your repository will be indicated by the
clock-arrow icon in the status bar. The icon will appear orange when it's
requesting the build status, green if the build was successful and red if the
build failed.

The build status is updated when the project is first opened in Atom and from
then on whenever the "status" of the project repository changes. The handling of
these events was borrowed from the `git-view.coffee` part of the `status-bar`
package.

### Commands

The following commands are available for users to keymap.

* `travis-ci-status:toggle` - Toggle the status bar entry
* `travis-ci-status:open-on-travis` - Open the project on the Travis CI site
